Pre project thoughts

The goal is to create a GUI program, similar to my PDFsplitter, than will let me specify a range of pages and extract these pages to a new PDF. I also want to be able to preview the pages. 

Example. I want to be able to save the ranges visually and edit and remove after they have been saved. Should be seen in tkinter window. This is half the window. 

On left side there should the PDF. I should be able to scroll through PDF and when I find a page which I want to start the extract from i should be able to press a button to indicate start page and then press again to indicate end page. This should be saved to the right side of the window.

When I am done I press okay. 

This leads to next phase. Naming of the PDFs. This can be a different program. 

One by one i go through the extracted PDFs in a folder. The pdfs are still visualized on the left. On the right I can enter a name for the PDF. When I press next pdf it saves the pdf name and shows me next PDF. This ends when there are no more PDFs.
